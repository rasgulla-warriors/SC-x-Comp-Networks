## Problem Statement

**Title:** Optimizing Customer-Centric ISP Network Routing through Dynamic Graph Neural Networks and Social Computing Insights

### Introduction
As internet usage continues to grow, optimizing routing in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks becomes increasingly critical. Traditional routing methods often fail to account for dynamic traffic patterns and customer-centric needs, leading to inefficiencies. This research proposes the application of **Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs)** to enhance routing strategies by modeling the network as a dynamic graph that adapts to real-time conditions.

### Objectives
1. **Utilize DGNNs for Network Routing:**
   - Develop a framework that employs DGNNs to dynamically adjust routing paths based on real-time data and traffic patterns.
   - Focus on enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as latency, bandwidth, and packet loss.

2. **Incorporate Social Computing Principles:**
   - Explore the analogy between information flow in computer networks and human social networks.
   - Investigate how community structures (cliques, triads, etc.) in social networks can inform routing strategies in ISP networks.

### Research Questions
1. **Can social network theories improve routing efficiency?**
   - How can the identification of community structures within networks lead to more effective routing algorithms?
   
2. **Is there a correlation between information flow in computer networks and social communities?**
   - To what extent can techniques used in social computing be applied to optimize data routing in ISP networks?

3. **What are the implications of modeling networks as social structures?**
   - Would adopting a social computing perspective lead to insights that enhance both customer satisfaction and network performance?

### Hypothesis
The flow of information across computer networks may parallel the dynamics of information flow within human communities. By applying social computing techniques—such as analyzing cliques and triads—to ISP network routing, we hypothesize that it is possible to achieve more efficient data transmission pathways that reflect human interaction patterns.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Gather real-time traffic data from ISP networks alongside social interaction data from user communities.
- **Model Development:** Design DGNN architectures that integrate features from both network performance metrics and social computing insights.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of proposed routing strategies against traditional methods using metrics like average latency, packet drop ratio, and user satisfaction.

### Significance
This research aims to bridge the gap between network optimization and social computing, potentially leading to innovative solutions that enhance ISP routing efficiency while prioritizing customer experience. By understanding network interactions through a social lens, we may uncover new strategies for managing data flows in increasingly complex digital environments.

This structured approach clarifies your research focus and sets a strong foundation for exploring the intersection of technology and social dynamics in network optimization.
